# Tinkercad Projects

This repository contains a collection of 3D designs and circuit projects I created using Tinkercad in my Robotics and Elements of Engineering classes.

The repository includes:
- `.md` files explaining each project  
- `.stl` files for 3D designs  
- `.ino` files containing Arduino (C++) code for circuit projects
